/**
 * Calculates RELL bootstrap replicates at different replicate sequence lengths in parallel, calculate empirical CDF
 * functions from the resulting BP counts, and calculate the AU test p-value from that.
 *
 * The class is instanced with a pointer to the MSA and persite-loglikelihood matrix, as well as scaling factors for the
 * replicate sequence lengths and number of replicates per scale, a random seed, and the number of trees.
 *
 * It then allows repeated calculation of the AU test in parallel, as long as the number of trees remains constant.
 * The bootstrapping and p value calculation happens in three steps, since some of them can be run in parallel, and
 * some happen on one thread only, after gathering the data.
